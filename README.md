# Bike-Management-System
Languages= Python and Java

Introduction:
In this Bike Management System, I have used the concepts of Java programming language and Python programming language to develop an efficient, functional, and comprehensive project. I have  employed a wide variety of features from the Java and Python language to design, develop, debug and improvise the system. 

Features of Program:
• Password Protected at Employee level and secures data from intruders.(123)
• A much simpler and modular approach has been adopted instead of complex intervened code.
• The program serves the user with a user-friendly menu to choose from.
• Use of Modules to make the main program concise and easier to understand.
• Data from the entered records is stored in file so that the user can retrieve the data next time they log on.
• Data is read back when program is run again.
• The user has freedom to enter as many records as they want.
• Program runs fast without any unnecessary delays and has an uncluttered interface with proper instruction at each level.
• To avoid repetitive code, global variables have been used throughout the program.
• The program uses only one file to run and no extra dependencies.
• Exception handling has been done throughout the project to avoid any unintended error from popping up.
• File Handling has been done to allow the user to store data.

Modules used in Program
The Program uses modules to make main program shorter and easier to understand. Each module has a function of its own which is called upon whenever necessary.
All methods involving viewing, editing, searching and deleting make sure data is first present. Otherwise they prompt the user to add data first.
